# MatheGrafx
Classes which implement algebraic structures, like fields, groups and rings, and a GUI to use these classes. It's main goal is to function as a graphic calculator with a lot of extra functionality, like linear algebra, a root finder, and many others.
It started out as mainly a linear algebra project, but will soon become much broader.
